python program to find the median of two sorted arrays.

this program Merge the two arrays and sort them.
In this implementation, we first merge the two input arrays and sort 
them using the sorted() function. We then get the length of the merged
 array, and if the length is odd, we return the middle element; otherwise,
 we return the average of the middle two elements.


Example :-

input == find_median_sorted_arrays([], [1])
output == 1.00






input == find_median_sorted_arrays([2], [])
output == 2.00
